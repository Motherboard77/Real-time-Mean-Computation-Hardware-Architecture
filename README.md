# Real-time-Mean-Computation-Hardware-Architecture
The designed architecture is capable of computing arithmetic mean of any arbitrary sequence of numbers, given as input having a fixed-point notation. Using a novel bypass, shift-and-add circuitry, the architecture was tested using a data-set of 20 fixed-point numbers with 16-bit word size from a pre-built memory controller module. All the results were achieved in Xilinx Vivado 2019.
